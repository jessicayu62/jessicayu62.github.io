  			<h1>My Tech Journey</h1>
  			<h5>I have always enjoyed math, but it wasn't until later that I got to explore the different STEM fields, like computer science. Since then, my passion for CS and learning about social issues in tech has grown tremendously.</h5>

			      <h2>Seventh Grade 2014-2015</h2>
			      <p>An elective course that I wanted to take was full, so I was placed in a class called "Storytech," where students learn block-based programming. I had no interest in the course initially, but after only a few days, I started to love playing around with code and creating mini-projects.</p>

			      <h2>Ninth Grade 2016-2017</h2>
			      <p>I joined the "Girls Who Code" club at my high school. We went on field trips to tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google, which were my first experiences inside a tech company. I was amazed by the campuses and how employees worked on projects that I didn't know were possible with technology.</p>

			      <h2>Summer to Eleventh Grade 2018</h2>
			      <p>I participated in the 7-week Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program (GWC SIP) at Walmart Labs, where we learned a new language each week. We had the opportunity to hear from many inspiring women in tech and visit tech companies like Youtube. It was my first time hearing about UI/UX design, and from then I became interested in following that path.</p>
			      <p>
			      After the program, I became more confident in pursuing CS and educated about the challenges women face in tech.</p>

			      <h2>Eleventh Grade 2018-2019</h2>
			      <p>I served as the president of the Girls Who Code Club at my school. As president, I wanted members to learn something new and feel inspired at each meeting, which I felt was lacking when I was a member for 2 years. So, I created slideshows that included inspiring women in tech videos, games, and upcoming tech events for each meeting. I also organized a field trip to a tech company. After the program, I became more confident in pursuing CS and educated about the challenges women face in tech.</p>
			      <!-- <p>I also joined a student-run organization at my school called "Women in Leadership". Because I was extremely inspired after attending their first session, I reached out to the student who ran the event and joined the team. We invited women with leadership positions to speak to our school monthly; our mission was to normalize the idea of women in positions in power and inspire high school girls. 
			      </p> -->
<!-- 			      <p>In addition, I took a Python-based computer science class at my high school, where I applied what I've learned from GWC SIP to the class and built more programming techniques.</p> -->

			      <h2>Summer to Twelfth Grade 2019</h2>
			      <!-- <p>I interned at San Mateo County of Education which strives for equity in education. This internship taught me to be more ambitious and sparked a passion to learn more about the inequities in education and the effects.</p> -->
			      <p>I was introduced to the "Bay Area Youth Computer Science Council" (BAYCSC), an organization led by a team of high school students to make CS more accessible and inclusive through providing resources and hosting events for all audiences. I took on the role of Head Diversity and Equity Officer.</p>

			      <h2>Twelfth Grade 2019-2020</h2>
			      <p>I took the math class Multivariable Calculus. I enjoyed the course a lot, making me rethink what I wanted to do with CS and whether I still wanted to dive into UI/UX design.</p>
			      <p>I continued with my leadership roles in the GWC club and BAYCSC. Within GWC, I worked with the other officers to organize 3 guest speakers and improve club attendance.</p>
			      <p>For BAYCSC, I took on different responsibilities, such as managing our social media and designing event flyers. We organized CS workshops, speaker events, and a study group. BAYCSC helped me become more aware of the lack of CS education and resources for underrepresented communities, inspiring me to continue making a change beyond high school.</p>

			      <h2>Summer to first-year of University 2020</h2>
			      <p>I participated as a scholar in Kode With Klossy's 2-week virtual web development program. I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a website with a team (and met Karlie Kloss and Ashton Kutcher virtually!). Similar to GWC's SIP, the community was strong and supportive. The program has inspired me to create more projects on my own, such as this website!</p>
