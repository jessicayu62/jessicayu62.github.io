  			<h1>My Tech Journey</h1>
  			<h5>Since elementary school, I had an interest in math. But it wasn't until later that I got to play around with the different aspects of STEM, like computer science. And since then, my passion for it has tremendously grown, with the addition of social issues in tech. </h5>

			      <h2>Seventh Grade 2014-2015</h2>
			      <p>In middle school, I had to take an elective course for one semester. However the class I wanted to take was too full, so I was placed in a class called "Storytech", where students code starting with block-based programming. Because it was a fairly new course, I had no clue what the class' agenda was and had no interest in it. But after spending only a few days in the class, I loved it. I had so much fun playing around with the different pieces of code and creating mini-projects. Even after the class ended, I found myself coding in my free time at home using the websites that we used to learn at school. This was the starting point of my love for coding.</p>

			      <h2>Ninth Grade 2016-2017</h2>
			      <p>Once high school started, I knew I wanted to join a computer science club. One that caught my interest was "Girls Who Code" as I heard about this organization before. We went on different field trips to tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google, which were my first experiences seeing inside a tech company before. I was amazed by the campuses and how employees were working on projects that I didn't know was possible with technology. It was so new and exciting for me and I wanted to learn more.</p>

			      <h2>Summer to Eleventh Grade 2018</h2>
			      <p>This summer I participated in the 7-week Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program (GWC SIP). My program was located at Walmart Labs in San Bruno. Each week we learned a new language such as Python and HTML. At the beginning of each week, I struggled to understand and retain the information I learned; however, the support I had from my peers and instructors made it easy to not feel ashamed for that. We also had the opportunity to hear from many inspiring women in tech and visit other tech companies like Youtube. It was my first time hearing about the path of UI/UX design and from then I became interested in following that path.
			      </p>
			      <p>
			      After the seven weeks I spent at Walmart Labs, I felt more confident in my choice to pursue CS and it helped me picture what I want my future career to look like. I also became more aware of the way women are treated in the tech field and the lack of diversity.</p>

			      <h2>Eleventh Grade 2018-2019</h2>
			      <p>During junior year, I served as the President of Girls Who Code club at my school. As president, I wanted members to learn something new and feel inspired each meeting, which I didn't feel strongly when I was a member for 2 years since the previous club meetings didn't have an agenda. So, I created slideshows that included inspiring women in tech videos, games, and upcoming tech events for each meeting. I also organized a fieldtrip to a tech company. But I still had a lot to learn as a leader.</p>
			      <p>I also joined a student-run organization at my school called "Women in Leadership". After attending their first session, I was extremely inspired; so, I reached out to the student who ran the event and joined the team. We invited women with leadership positions to speak to our school monthly; our mission was to normalize the idea of women in positions in power and inspire high school girls. Not only was I pursuing my passion for closing the gender gap in tech with GWC club, but I was also working towards a new goal of transforming the way women are perceived in the workforce, specifically as leaders. 
			      </p>
			      <p>In addition, I took a Python-based computer science class at my high school, where I applied what I've learned from GWC SIP to the class and built more programming techniques. I also took AP Physics C: Mechanics which proved to be very challenging but it was a subject that I enjoyed struggling through and changed the way I perceive the motions around me.

			      <h2>Summer to Twelfth Grade 2019</h2>
			      <p>I interned at San Mateo County of Education which strives for equity in education. This internship sparked a passion for me to learn more about the inequities in education and how it affects students; it taught me how to be more ambitious and I truly had an unforgettable experience working with the other interns and my mentors.</p>
			      <p> My mentor also introduced me to a newly created organization called, "Bay Area Youth Computer Science Council" (BAYCSC), which is run by a team of high school students to make CS more accessible and inclusive through providing resources and hosting events for all audiences. I took on the role of Head Diversity and Equity Officer.</p>

			      <h2>Twelfth Grade 2019-2020</h2>
			      <p>I took the math class, Multivariable Calculus. Although it was challenging, I was excited to go to the class everyday. It made me rethink what I wanted to do with CS and whether I still wanted to dive into UI/UX design. I also took AP Computer Science A, a Java based course, where I got to see my programming and critical thinking skills evolve. </p>
			      <p>In my senior year of high school, I continued with my leadership roles in GWC club and BAYCSC. Within GWC, I was able to take what I've learned during my junior year to improve. I worked with the other officers to organize 3 guest speakers and improve club attendance.</p>
			      <p>For BAYCSC, I took on different responsibilities such as managing our social media and creating event flyers. We organized CS workshops, speaker events, and a study group, inspiring many students(even globally through our online speaker series). Through BAYCSC I learned so much about organizing events and making a difference in my communities. It made me more aware of the lack of CS education and resources for underrepresented communities and has inspired me to continue making a change beyond high school.</p>

			      <h2>Summer to first-year of University 2020</h2>
			      <p>I participated as a scholar in Kode With Klossy's 2-week virtual web development program, where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a website with a team. Similar to GWC's SIP, the community was strong and supportive. One of the differences between GWC SIP and KWK was the fact that I was more open during KWK. Within the 2 years between the programs, the experiences I had as a leader and as a student made me more comfortable with being brave and outgoing. During KWK, we even got to meet Karlie Kloss and Ashton Kutcher virtually! The program has inspired me to create more projects on my own, such as this website!</p>
